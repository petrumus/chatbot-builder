    // === FAQ Page ===
    faqTitle: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    faq1Q: "What makes this different from other chatbots?",
    faq1A: "Most chatbots follow scripts \u2014 they present options, the user clicks, the bot presents more options. That\u2019s a decision tree with a chat interface. Our AI agent learns from your live website, generates contextually appropriate responses, and \u2014 in the full version \u2014 takes real actions in your real systems. It books appointments, updates CRMs, sends confirmations, and monitors open items. It\u2019s the difference between a phone menu and an employee who knows your business.",
    faq2Q: "What can the AI agent actually do?",
    faq2A: "Five capability layers: (1) Task execution \u2014 books appointments, creates tickets, sends emails, updates records. (2) Proactive monitoring \u2014 watches for leads that haven\u2019t been followed up, tickets sitting unanswered, orders flagged for issues. (3) Autonomous decisions \u2014 enforces rules you define, like auto-escalating after missed responses. (4) Deep context \u2014 remembers customer history across sessions. (5) Open integrations \u2014 connects to anything online.",
    faq3Q: "How long does setup take?",
    faq3A: "The demo builds in under 60 seconds \u2014 just enter your website and a description. Full deployment with integrations and workflows takes a few days with our Setup Sprint ($499 one-time), where we map your workflows, configure everything, test, and deploy.",
    faq4Q: "What systems does it integrate with?",
    faq4A: "Anything that\u2019s online. CRMs (HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce), calendars (Google Calendar, Calendly), helpdesks (Zendesk, Freshdesk), e-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce), communication tools (Slack, email), and any other web-based tool with an API.",
    faq5Q: "How do we trust it to act autonomously?",
    faq5A: "You define the boundaries. The agent never acts outside the rules you set. You tell it: \u201cYou can book appointments, but never cancel without confirmation.\u201d \u201cYou can offer a 10% discount, never more.\u201d Everything outside the defined perimeter gets flagged for a human. You start narrow, watch it work, and expand the permissions over time.",
    faq6Q: "We don\u2019t need this yet \u2014 is it too early?",
    faq6A: "The right time to set this up is before you feel the pain. Once a business handles 50+ customer interactions a day, every minute of delay costs a lead or a satisfaction score. The agent starts small and scales with you \u2014 you\u2019re not buying enterprise software, you\u2019re hiring a 24/7 team member at a fraction of the cost.",
    faq7Q: "Is there a free trial?",
    faq7A: "Yes. The free demo lets you build and chat with an AI agent (30 messages, no signup). Every paid plan also includes 1,000 free chats as a proof of concept, so you can validate the agent on real conversations before committing.",
    faq8Q: "What languages are supported?",
    faq8A: "All languages are fully supported with no limitations. The AI agent handles multilingual conversations natively \u2014 whether your customers speak English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Arabic, or any other language.",
    faq9Q: "How does billing work?",
    faq9A: "Monthly or annual billing (save ~17% on annual). If you exceed your conversation limit, overage is charged per conversation at a reduced rate. When monthly overage exceeds 30% of your plan price, we recommend upgrading \u2014 no surprise bills.",
    faq10Q: "What kind of support do we get?",
    faq10A: "Starter: email support. Pro: priority email + chat support. Business: priority support + quarterly review call. Enterprise: dedicated account manager with custom SLA. All paid plans include guided onboarding.",
